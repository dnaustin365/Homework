The image I chose as my inspiration for this cohort is that of Michael Kelly. Mike was a 2-time graduate of SavvyCoders, and landed a job at Accenture Federal Services. This is inspirational for me because I previously worked for Accenture LLP, and was in the process of trying to transfer to Federal Services. I would be grateful for any opportunity I receive to work in Data Analytics, however to work for AFS would be somewhat of a dream come true. I am very excited to learn and develop new skills in data and carry them forward into a new career in technology.
